This is my own AllSkyCamera for Astrophotography.
It runs on a kickpi (cheaper than an RPi) running Ubuntu 21.
The ESP sidecar is optional
For full instructions on set-up see the other md files.

SketchUp file is included to print all the parts.
Printed with PLA, then spray with GorillaSealant to give a nice finish and weather seal the device.
